# Differential Equation Solver for TypeScript

A simple Typescript Library for Approximating Solutions to Ordinary Differential Equations using Euler's method.

This project is very simple, but is a proving ground for my future ideas for Mathematics in JS/TS.

## Installation

Installation is easy using NPM:

- Install it directly from NPM

        npm i differential-solver

- From GitHub

        npm i github.com/cooperw824/differential-solver

- From Source

        git clone github.com/cooperw824/differential-solver

        npm i differential-solver
